<h1>Vulnerability Management (Nessus Tenable)</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I developed a cybersecurity project focused on assessing vulnerabilities using Nessus Tenable within a Windows 10 Virtual Machine on VMWare Workstation. The project comprised unauthenticated scans to uncover initial weaknesses, authenticated scans for deeper evaluation, a specialized deprecated software scan targeting outdated components, and finally, post-remediation scans to validate the effectiveness of implemented solutions. This comprehensive approach ensured a thorough assessment and strengthening of the system's security.
